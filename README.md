#### Flash-Cards

Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through
them quickly (back or front), and use the keyboard flip the card,
and to mark whether they got it right or not. Track which cards
were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them
right!

  *Bonus:*
    * Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
    * Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
    * Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)
